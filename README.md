# Metal Stack API

The metal-api is one of the major components of the Metal Stack control plane. It is both the public interface for users to manage machines, networks, ips, and so forth and it is also the interface for Metal Stack components running inside a partition.

The CLI tool for using the API is called `metalctl`. You can find this project [here](https://github.com/metal-stack/metalctl).
